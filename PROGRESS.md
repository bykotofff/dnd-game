3. User session persistence in Redis
4. Role-based access (admin features ready)

#### Character Data Flow
1. Forms → Validation → API → Database
2. Real-time updates via React Query
3. Optimistic updates for better UX
4. Error handling with toast notifications

#### Styling System
1. Tailwind CSS with custom fantasy theme
2. Component variants for consistency
3. Dark mode with system preference detection
4. Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 🚀 Next Phase: Campaign & Game System
